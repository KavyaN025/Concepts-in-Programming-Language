## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔢 1. 1024-bit Big Integer Calculator
Implements arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on large integers up to 1024 bits using C. Demonstrates bit-level manipulation and number representation.

### 🗃️ 2. Heap Allocation Simulator
Simulates heap memory management including malloc/free, fragmentation, and garbage collection concepts. Helps understand manual memory management in low-level languages.

### 🧭 3. Scope Tables (Symbol Table Manager)
Implements a scope table (symbol table) with nested scope handling. Demonstrates concepts such as lexical scoping, symbol resolution, and data type tracking.

### 🧪 4. Optimized Code Analysis
Includes sample C programs compiled with `-O0` and `-O2` using GCC. Contains line-by-line analysis of generated assembly code to understand compiler optimizations like:
- Constant folding
- Inlining
- Loop unrolling
- Dead code elimination

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- GCC Compiler
